# Auto-download
Hi guys,<br>
This is just a project that I made for fun...Try it and tell me what can I improve.

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
1. Must be using a chromium based browser...or else you have to change few lines in the code.<br>
2. Find the version of ur browser and download the chromedriver accordingly as things might change in future.

<h2>Setup</h2>
1. Specify the path for browser .exe/.dmg file.<br>
2. If you are using any download manager...Download its .crx file and replace it with fdm.crx file. As a matter of fact I am using free download manager(fdm). I recommend using one as browser will close after fetching ur file.

<h2>Note</h2>
1. You can download everything present on dramacool websites.<br>
2. Sometimes u might have to fill the captcha. For easy, I have given buster extension. As soon as captcha page opens try to click the <i>human sign with tick<i> it might solve the captcha automatically. In case it doesn't solve just click on <i>eye<i> and do it manually.<br>

<h3>Enjoy!! ðŸ˜‰<h3>
